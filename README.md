<h2 align="center"> Introduction </h2> <br>
To improve my programming abilities i challanged myself to make some games. Thats the first one of them and it will be a simplistic project. I would like to say that this will be the very first project that i will make without any help. <b> Hope you enjoy it! </b>
<h2 align="center">Project description</h2>
The project is based on 2D graphics and will only have 2 playable character.<br>
The movements are simple, you can: attack and move to the left, right and up(jump).<br>
Will be pixeled graphics for the sake of my computer memory card :)<br>
<b> If you have any ideas to improve this code, contact me, thanks </br>
